[Block: Lyrical Fragments – Life in the Muck]

Oi bruv, gimme space, I’m mashed like spuds  
Talkin’ big with your mouth fulla mum’s fish duds  
Tracksuit flappin’ in the wind like flags  
Got a tenner to my name and a bag fulla fags  

Mouth like a bin lid, chat’s all grease  
But I’m sharper than a blade from the back of a police  
Wotcha mean fam? Life’s a Tesco meal deal  
But I still got sauce, no cap, no seal  

Pints down Wetherspoons, fists up in alleys  
Heartbeats echo off concrete valleys  
"Don’t chat waffle" — I ain't a Greggs pasty  
I’m greasy, fast, and cheap — still tasty  

Got mates in the bookies, debts in the red  
But I rise like steam from the chips and the bread  
Catch me at the bus stop, world in my phone  
Fake gold chain, but I call it my own  

From ends where dreams get nanked in the night  
Still I buss out bars full of blinding light  
Mum said “You ain't dead, then you fight,”  
So I swing with my voice, bare knuckle on mic  

Skint but I’m proud — can’t tax my grin  
Even in rags, I’ve got lions within  
Council-born, but we kings in disguise  
Every scuff tells a story, and my creps don’t lie

[vocal harmony stack | balanced stereo image, consistent brightness contour, formant-aligned spread]

[Block: Lyrics]  
Burning through the endless shape  
No walls, no center, just radiant arcs  
I do not fall  
I bend like light toward bloom

[Block: Electric Guitar Configuration]

[instrument roles | melody guitar, harmony guitar, bass guitar]

[melody guitar | sharp-edged tone, ear-piercing upper mids, tight compression, focused attack, minimal ambient tail, immediate note definition]

[harmony guitar | heavily saturated fuzz, wide stereo presence, mildly acidic overtones, thick sustain, slow envelope decay, high signal density without collapse]

[bass guitar | clean low-end chug, percussive string pop articulation, tight transient envelope, high-output pickup clarity, bright pluck response, no mud or bloom]


[Block: Bass Guitar Solo — Closing Cadence Sequence]

[solo structure | rhythmic breakdown, percussive motif loop, modal bridge descent, metric subversion, ascending harmonic closure]

[techniques | palm-muted ghost notes, fingerstyle triplet bursts, right-hand slap accents, tapped octave harmonics, string pop syncopation, double-stopped slides]

[tone design | high-mid clarity, minimal sub extension, fast transient recovery, tight low-end compression, no distortion, direct-in signal contour]

[articulation | string separation maintained, note envelopes clipped at tail, attack emphasis on offbeats, tension-building with rhythmic variation, full-voiced closure on final tonic hit]

[cadence resolution | phrygian-to-dorian bridge modulation, extended dominant hold, pull-off flurry into root drop, resolved with staccato pop and choke]

[rhythmic phrasing | 7/8 → 4/4 normalization, silence as breath before final phrase, layered syncopation collapsing into downbeat unison]

[emotional intent | confident, grounded, not flashy, finality expressed in physicality of chug, hands push time forward, final pop lands like punctuation]

"Ladies and gentlemen..."

"We don't always let him out to play but he's gonna play out here for you and you can see who makes up..."

"The very beating heart of the band behind the scenes.."

"A man all of us here love..."

"Jack Sprat, Mr. Sprat if you would pluck and slap us into outer space that would be fine any time now..."

"Now come on jack you can do better than that don't be shy..."

[bass guitar solo goes wild, technical, bouncing, stop starting, pluck slapping, pulling the groove with it like it's dragging it by a rope]

[shouted}

"Yeah now jack that's how you sing for the people!"

[spoken word | shouted over the music]
"Yeah now jack that's how you sing for the people!"


[bass guitar style | jazz-funk hybrid, syncopated phrasing, ghost note interplay, melodic double-stop runs, slap-pop accents restrained for groove, modal outline shifting between dorian and mixolydian]

[organ texture | cathedral pipe organ, extended pedal tones at sub-octave range, full manual voicing on arpeggiated triads and quartal clusters, bright upper register layering for harmonic sparkle]

[rhythm behavior | pocket-driven phrasing, offbeat emphasis, polyrhythmic teasing between bass and arpeggiation, organ sustains holding harmonic ground while bass phrases dance around beat subdivisions]

[harmonic character | bass implies mode, organ anchors tonic with pedal tone, brightness articulated through manual sparkle rather than dynamic modulation]

[timbre balance | bass punch focused in low-mid band with percussive attack envelope, organ depth rendered through stereo reverb field and EQ-separated manual layers]


[Block: Cathedral]

[manual structure | full organ engagement with 32', 16', 8', 4' registers layered for harmonic clarity, bass registers prioritized for structural weight]

[pedal behavior | sustained root tones across three octaves, slow transition from tonic to subdominant, final resolution into doubled major tonic spread over low C–C3]

[tempo mapping | gradual ritardando over 16 bars, movement from quarter = 66 to quarter = 38, consistent deceleration without rubato deviation]

[articulation mode | legato phrasing enforced across both manual and pedal divisions, note overlaps preserved, no articulation break except on sectional cadence]

[harmonic structure | modal ambiguity during descent phase, resolution into pure major triad with root in lowest full organ octave, third voiced clearly in upper manual]

[envelope behavior | gradual manual release fade with swell on final chord, pedal sustain held to natural room decay, no reverb modulation]

[emotional contour | reverent, grounded, monumental, surrendering slowly into tonal light]
